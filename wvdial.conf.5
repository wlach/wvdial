.TH WVDIAL.CONF 5 "December 2005" "WvDial"
.\"
.SH NAME
wvdial.conf \- wvdial configuration file
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
When
.B wvdial
starts, it first loads its configuration from
.IR /etc/wvdial.conf ,
which contains basic information about the modem port, speed, and init
string, along with information about your Internet Service Provider (ISP),
such as the phone number, your username, and your password.
.sp
The configuration file
.I /etc/wvdial.conf
is in Windows "ini" file format, with
.B sections
named in square brackets and a number of
.B variable = value
pairs within each section.
.PP
Here is a sample configuration file:
.PP
.RS
[Dialer Defaults]
.br
Modem = /dev/ttyS2
.br
Baud = 57600
.br
Init = ATZ
.br
Init2 = AT S11=50
.br
Phone = 555-4242
.br
Username = apenwarr
.br
Password = my-password
.sp
[Dialer phone2]
.br
Phone = 555-4243
.sp
[Dialer shh]
.br
Init3 = ATM0
.sp
[Dialer pulse]
.br
Dial Command = ATDP
.RE
.PP
The sample configuration file above contains all of the options
necessary to run the two sample command lines given above.  Here is a
complete list of settings that
.B wvdial
understands:
.TP
.I Modem
The location of the device that
.B wvdial
should use as your modem.  The default is
.BR /dev/modem .
.TP
.I Baud
The speed at which
.B wvdial
will communicate with your modem.  The default is 57600 baud.
.TP
.I No Hardware Protocol
If value is set,
.B wvdial
will not use hardware protocol for connections.
.TP
.I "Init1 ... Init9"
.B wvdial
can use up to nine initialization strings to set up your modem.  Before
dialing, these strings are sent to the modem in numerical order.  These are
particularly useful when specifying multiple sections.  See above for an
example that uses Init3 to turn the modem's speaker off.  The default is
"ATZ" for Init1.
.TP
.I Phone
The phone number you want
.B wvdial
to dial. You can add up to 4 other phone numbers that
.B wvdial
will dial in order, by adding:
.TP
.I Phone1
.TP
.I Phone2
.TP
.I Phone3
.TP
.I Phone4
.TP
.I Dial Prefix
.B wvdial
will insert this string after the dial command and before the phone number.
For example, to disable call waiting (in North America, anyway) set
this to "*70,".
.TP
.I Dial Command
.B wvdial
will use this string to tell the modem to dial.  The default is "ATDT".
.TP
.I Login
You must set this to the username you use at your ISP.
.TP
.I Login Prompt
If your ISP has an unusual login procedure that
.B wvdial
is unable to figure out, you can use this option to specify a
login prompt.  When this prompt is received from your ISP,
.B wvdial
will send the
.B Login
string.
.TP
.I Password
You must set this to the password you use at your ISP.
.TP
.I Ask Password
By setting this option
.B wvdial
will prompt for your password on every dialin.  Thus you don't have to save
your password in
.IR /etc/wvdial.conf .
(Option added by SuSE.)
.TP
.I Password Prompt
If your ISP has an unusual login procedure that
.B wvdial
is unable to figure out, you can use this option to specify a
password prompt.   When this prompt is received from you ISP,
.B wvdial
will send the
.B Password
string.
.TP
.I PPPD Path
If your system has pppd somewhere other than
.BR "/usr/sbin/pppd" ,
you will need to set this option.
.TP
.I Auto DNS
Try to get the Domain Nameserver (DNS) from the provider.  This option is "on"
by default.  (Option added by SuSE.)
.TP
.I Check DNS
Check the Domain Nameserver (DNS) after the connection has been set
up.  This option is "on" by default.  (Option added by SuSE.)
.TP
.I DNS Test1
First DNS lookup for DNS check.  (Option added by SuSE.)
.TP
.I DNS Test2
Second DNS lookup for DNS check.  (Option added by SuSE.)
.TP
.I Check Def Route
Check the default route after the connection has been set
up.  This option is "on" by default.  (Option added by SuSE.)
.TP
.I Force Address
This option only applies if you have a static IP address at your ISP, and
even then you probably don't need it.  Some ISP's don't send the IP address
as part of the PPP negotiation.  This option forces pppd to use the address
you give it.
.TP
.I Remote Name
If your ISP uses PAP or CHAP authentication, you might need to change this
to your ISP's authentication name.  In most cases, however, it's safe to use
the default value, "*".
.TP
.I Carrier Check
.B wvdial
checks your modem during the connection process to ensure that it is actually
online.  If you have a weird modem that insists its carrier line is always
down, you can disable the carrier check by setting this option to "no".
.TP
.I Stupid Mode
When
.B wvdial
is in Stupid Mode, it does not attempt to interpret any prompts from the
terminal server.  It starts pppd immediately after the modem connects.
Apparently there are ISP's that actually give you a login prompt, but
work only if you start PPP, rather than logging in.  Go figure.  Stupid
Mode is (naturally) disabled by default.
.TP
.I New PPPD
You need this option if you have pppd version 2.3.0 or newer, to make
wvdial create the file
.BR /etc/ppp/peers/wvdial .
This option is enabled by default, thus if you have older pppd you need
to set it to `no' (or upgrade pppd).
.TP
.I Default Reply
When
.B wvdial
detects a prompt, and it hasn't seen any clues that indicate what it should
send as a response to the prompt, it defaults to sending "ppp".  Sometimes
this is inadequate.  Use this option to override
.BR wvdial 's
default prompt response.
.TP
.I Auto Reconnect
If enabled,
.B wvdial
will attempt to automatically reestablish a connection if you are
randomly disconnected by the other side.
This option is "on" by default.
.TP
.I Idle Seconds
Set the hangup timeout in seconds.  If there is inactivity for the given
time the connection is shut down.  A hangup timeout of 0 disables this
feature.
.TP
.I Abort on Busy
If enabled,
.B wvdial
will not retry the connection if the modem says that the line is busy.
This option is "off" by default.
.TP
.I Abort on No Dialtone
If enabled,
.B wvdial
will not retry the connection if the modem says that there is no dialtone.
This option is "on" by default.
.TP
.I Dial Attempts
If value is set,
.B wvdial
will quit after that many tries .If set to 0,
.B wvdial
will happily keep dialling forever.
.TP
.I Dial Timeout
The maximum time in seconds that
.B wvdial
will wait for a connection to be made. Default value is 60 seconds.
.PP
The
.BR wvdialconf (1)
program can be used to detect your modem and fill in the Modem, Baud,
and Init/Init2 options automatically.
